# Repository Guidelines

## 1. Repository Naming
- Use clear, concise, and descriptive names.
- Avoid excessive abbreviations and generic terms.
- Suggested pattern: `client-project-technology`.

**Example:**  
`acme-ecommerce-nodejs`

## 2. Directory Structure
The directory structure should be consistent across projects to facilitate navigation. Follow the example below:


## 3. Essential Files
Ensure the following files are present at the root of the repository:

- `README.md`: Clear project description, installation, and usage instructions.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guide for contributing to the project.
- `LICENSE.md`: Project license.
- `.gitignore`: List of files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Project change log.

## 4. Branching Strategy
Use the **Git Flow** strategy for version control and collaborative development:

- `main`: Contains stable production code.
- `develop`: Main development branch integrating new features.
- `feature/xyz`: For developing new features.
- `hotfix/xyz`: For urgent production bug fixes.

## 5. Commit Messages
Commit messages should be short and explanatory. Use the following format:

**Example:**  
`feat(authentication): added JWT support`

## 6. Code Review
- All Pull Requests (PRs) must be reviewed by at least one other developer.
- Ensure tests pass before submitting a PR.
- Use continuous integration (CI) to automate testing and linting.

## 7. Code Standards
Follow established coding standards for each language:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: ESLint + Prettier
- **Python**: PEP8
- **Java**: Google Java Style Guide

## 8. Security and Compliance
- Ensure repositories follow the security standards defined by ISO 27001.
- Integrate vulnerability scanning for dependencies and code using tools like SonarQube and Dependabot.

## 9. Documentation
- Keep documentation up to date for both developers and end users.
- Use tools like Swagger for API documentation and PlantUML for architecture diagrams.
